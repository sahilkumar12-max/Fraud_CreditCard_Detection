### **Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task for financial institutions to prevent unauthorized activities and protect customer data. This project addresses key challenges such as class imbalance, employs advanced machine learning techniques, and outlines a plan for deploying the model into production for real-time use.

### **Problem Statement**

The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, fraudulent transactions constitute only 0.172% of the total data. The objective is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

### **Project Workflow**

#### **1. Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is essential to ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for machine learning.

- **Handling Class Imbalance:**
  - **Undersampling:** We reduced the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions) using `RandomUnderSampler` to balance the dataset.
  - **Oversampling:** The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (fraudulent transactions), helping improve class representation.
  - **Combined Approach (SMOTETomek):** SMOTE was combined with Tomek Links, which removed noisy or overlapping samples to create a cleaner, balanced dataset.

- **Feature Scaling:** Numeric features were normalized using scaling techniques to ensure that all features contribute equally and prevent features with larger values from dominating.

- **Dataset Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to ensure the model’s ability to generalize.

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA is used to understand the dataset and identify potential patterns or correlations that can inform model selection.

- **Class Distribution Analysis:** We analyzed the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions to quantify the level of imbalance.
- **Data Visualization:** Bar plots were created to visualize class distribution, and histograms and boxplots were used to explore the distribution of numeric features such as `TransactionAmount`.
- **Correlation Analysis:** We calculated the correlations between numeric features and the target variable to identify predictors of fraudulent transactions.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Outliers and anomalies were examined to uncover potentially fraudulent patterns.

---

#### **3. Model Development**
Model development involves building machine learning models that classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

- **Baseline Models:** We tested basic models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to establish a performance benchmark. These models also helped in understanding feature importance.
- **Advanced Models:** We experimented with more sophisticated models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, known for their ability to handle imbalanced datasets and produce high-performing results.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Given the dataset’s imbalance, we focused on metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC to assess performance:
  - **Precision:** Measures the correctness of fraudulent predictions.
  - **Recall:** Measures how many actual fraudulent transactions were correctly detected.
  - **F1-Score:** Provides a balance between Precision and Recall.
  - **AUC-ROC:** Evaluates the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.

---

#### **4. Hyperparameter Tuning**
Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance by identifying the best combination of parameters.

- **GridSearchCV:** We performed an exhaustive search over predefined hyperparameter grids for models like Random Forest, tuning parameters such as:
  - `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest.
  - `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree.
  - `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples required to split a node.
  - `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum samples required at a leaf node.

- **Cross-Validation:** We used 3-fold cross-validation during grid search to ensure the model generalizes well across different data subsets.

- **Best Model Selection:** The best combination of hyperparameters was selected and the model was evaluated on the test set.

---

#### **5. Model Evaluation**
After tuning the model, we evaluated its performance using the test data.

- **Confusion Matrix:** We analyzed the confusion matrix to understand the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Report:** A classification report provided Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class.
- **AUC-ROC Curve:** The AUC-ROC curve was plotted to visualize the model’s performance across various thresholds.
- **Insights:**
  - A high **Recall** was achieved to minimize the risk of missing fraudulent transactions.
  - **False positives** were minimized to reduce unnecessary alerts.

---

#### **6. Model Deployment Plan**
The deployment plan involves preparing the model for integration into production systems.

- **Model Saving:** The best model was serialized using `joblib` and saved as `fraud_detection_model.pkl`.
  
- **Deployment Code:** Example code to load and use the model for predictions:
  ```python
  import joblib
  model = joblib.load('fraud_detection_model.pkl')
  predictions = model.predict(new_data)
  ```

- **Integration:** The trained model can be integrated into fraud detection systems to provide real-time predictions.
- **Scalability:** The model is lightweight and can handle high volumes of transactions in real-time.
